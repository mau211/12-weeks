Semantic HTML
Exercise
We will be building a website in tribute to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. A designer has already created the CSS styling for us; we have to add in the HTML for the site.

Objectives
Learn about the different roles of HTML and CSS.
Learn about the different HTML elements available to us, including those that create content and those that group it.
Learn how to use the HTML validator to create valid HTML.
Starter Code
You can access the starter code for this exercise here, including an empty index.html page, a style.css page created by our designer, and an image we will insert into the page.

Try to get through as much as possible on your own; if you need additional help, read through this hints file.

Deliverable
This is what the website will look like:
